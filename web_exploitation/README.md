# Web Exploitation

## Browsers

### Chrome
In web exploitation, a beginner will probably rely heavily on Google Chrome developer tools, as well as several Chrome plugins. Some basic  plugins to install are:

   * Chrome Developer Tools. Become familiar with them. You can reach them by right-clicking and choosing `Inspect Element`, as well as under View->Developer->Developer Tools. Note that developer tools are almost always more useful than viewing source.
   * [Edit This Cookie](http://www.editthiscookie.com/start/) for changing cookie data.


### Firefox.

It is also handy to have firefox installed (We've also been told the 3d DOM view of FireFox is fun to look at.)
. One particular plugin we use is  the [Tamper Data](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tamper-data/) plugin.  Tamper Data is a proxy that inserts itself between the user and web site, and allows one to change data sent to the server.
